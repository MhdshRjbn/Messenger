# Messenger

A simple messenger project written in C++ by computer science students at Shahed University.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔐 **User Authentication**  
  Secure registration, login, logout, and account deletion using hashed passwords.

- 🧾 **User Data Management**  
  All user data is stored in JSON and managed securely by the C++ backend.

- 💬 **Private & Group Messaging**  
  Send, receive, and edit messages privately or within group chat rooms.

- 📩 **Unread Message Notifications**  
  Messages are marked as read/unread and notifications are displayed accordingly.

- 🧠 **Message Editing Logic**  
  Messages can be edited based on specific rules (e.g. time limits or unread status).

  Users can make real-time audio calls over the network with integrated voice streaming.

- 🤖 **Bot Integration**  
  Commands like `@echo` and `@all` allow automated interaction; additional bot stats supported.

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Multi-user Support**  
  Multiple users can interact simultaneously (thread-safe C++ backend).

- 💾 **Data Storage with SQLite (via Python API)**  
  Messages and metadata are stored in SQLite, accessed through a Python REST API server.

- 🌐 **Client-Server Architecture**  
  The C++ client communicates with a Python backend API over HTTP, enabling web-based deployment.

- 🔗 **Free Cloud Deployment**  
  The backend Python server and database are hosted on free cloud services (e.g. Render).

- 📤 **Export & Backup System**  
  Export chat history to `.txt` files; supports periodic backups and restoration via the API.

- 🖼️ **Modern User Interface with Qt**  
  Cross-platform graphical UI with message view, input panel, user list, and chat room navigator.

- 🛡️ **Optional File Encryption**  
  Sensitive exported data can be encrypted for additional privacy (optional feature).

- 🧪 **Cross-platform Development & Testing**  
  Built with CMake, runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS with full test coverage.
